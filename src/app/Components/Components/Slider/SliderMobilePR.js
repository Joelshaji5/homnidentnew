        "I have been undergoing dental treatment under Homnident. I find that getting the procedures done at home is very convenient as I can adjust time from my work from home schedule. Dr. Mahak takes time to explain all the procedures. She explains all the pros and cons of the treatment so that I can make an independent decision. Her assisting staff is also extremely helpful. She is an excellent doctor!!! Very thorough and caring. I recently had the teeth scaling and brightening treatment under her and am thrilled with the results. I am generally afraid of dental procedures but she's very sensitive to that and goes the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. I am now a permanent customer of Homnident clinic.",
